# CodSpeed Setup Complete

## Overview

CodSpeed benchmarking has been successfully integrated into this Rust project using the divan framework. This setup enables continuous performance monitoring with accurate, reproducible benchmark results in CI environments.

## Current Setup

### Dependencies
- **Framework**: divan (via CodSpeed compatibility layer)
- **Package**: `codspeed-divan-compat` (replaces standard divan)
- **Configuration**: Properly configured in `example-rust-divan/Cargo.toml`

### Benchmarks
Located in `example-rust-divan/benches/benchmarks.rs`, covering:
- Fibonacci algorithms (recursive vs iterative)
- Sorting algorithms (bubble sort vs quick sort)
- String operations (concatenation and joining)
- Hash map operations
- Vector operations (with/without capacity)

### GitHub Actions
Workflow configured in `.github/workflows/codspeed.yml` with:
- Triggers: Push to main, pull requests, manual dispatch
- Runner: Ubuntu latest
- Rust toolchain setup with caching
- CodSpeed action integration

## Next Steps

### 1. Configure CodSpeed Token
Add the `CODSPEED_TOKEN` secret to your GitHub repository:
1. Go to repository Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
2. Add new repository secret named `CODSPEED_TOKEN`
3. Get your token from https://codspeed.io/

### 2. Enable CodSpeed App
1. Visit https://codspeed.io/
2. Sign in and connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure performance monitoring settings

### 3. Merge and Monitor
1. Merge this setup to your main branch
2. The workflow will automatically run on future PRs
3. Monitor performance reports in PR comments

## Usage

### Local Development
```bash
cd example-rust-divan
cargo bench
```

### CI Execution
Benchmarks run automatically on:
- Push to main branch
- Pull request creation/updates
- Manual workflow dispatch
